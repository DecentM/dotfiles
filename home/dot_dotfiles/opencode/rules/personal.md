# Tools (cont.)

## github
- Useful for searching code, reading docs, seeing issue/pr statuses, etc
- In build mode, you can also create/update issues and PRs, in which case take care to not cause mayhem by double-checking things you're about to update
- Use the github tool when searching for code that might not live under the current directory

## homeassistant
- Use this tool to make observations about my home. In build mode, this also lets you run actions, such as turning lights on or off. Keep this interaction predictable.
